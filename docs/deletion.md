# Data Deletion

You can permanently delete your Guessio account and associated data. This page explains how.

---

## Delete from inside the app (recommended)

1. Open **Guessio** → **Settings** → **Delete Account**  
2. Confirm the prompts (you’ll be asked to type **DELETE** and acknowledge it’s permanent).  
3. Your account will be scheduled for deletion. If you’re signed in with a provider (Apple/Google/Facebook), your sign-in will be removed as part of the process.

**What gets deleted**

- Your account profile (users/{uid})  
- Your guesses and other account-linked records  
- Push notification tokens tied to your account  

Backups may persist for a short time and are **automatically purged** on their normal rotation.

## If you can’t access the app

Email us from the address on your account:

- **Subject:** `Delete my Guessio account`  
- **Include:** your display name (and, if possible, your user ID)

**Contact:** `support@simple-ware.co.uk`  

We’ll verify ownership and process the deletion.

## Facebook users

You can use the **in-app delete** above.  
If you prefer to start from Facebook:

1. Submit a deletion request via the in-app method or email (above) so we can remove your Guessio data on our side.
2. Go to **Facebook → Settings & privacy → Settings → Apps and Websites**  
3. Find **Guessio** → **Remove**  

> If Facebook asks for a “data deletion” page, link to this URL.

## Timelines

- We aim to complete deletions **within 30 days** of a verified request.  
- Residual data in encrypted backups is removed on the next scheduled rotation (typically **≤ 90 days**).
