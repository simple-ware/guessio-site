# Privacy Policy

**Guessio** provides an entertainment app where users make predictions with in-game currency. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## 1. What we collect
**Account & identifiers.** Apple/Google sign-in identifiers, Firebase `uid`, device push token.  
**App usage.** Session events (opening screens, placing guesses), timestamps, in-app purchases (StoreKit transaction IDs / receipts).  
**Content you create.** Usernames, guesses, and profile metadata.  

We do **not** collect sensitive categories (health, biometrics, precise location) and we do not sell personal data.

## 2. How we collect it
- **Authentication & database:** Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.
- **Payments:** Apple’s StoreKit for iOS purchases.
- **Analytics/Diagnostics:** Firebase Analytics.
- **Notifications:** Local notifications only.

## 3. How we use data
- Operate and improve the app (account access, leaderboards, event resolution).
- Prevent abuse (fraud/cheating detection, rate-limiting).
- Customer support and required legal purposes.

## 4. Sharing
- **Processors only.** We use service providers (e.g., Firebase/Google, Apple) to run core features. They process data on our behalf under contracts.  
- **Legal.** If required by law or to protect rights and safety.

## 5. Retention
We retain account and transaction records for as long as your account is active and as required for legal/accounting purposes. Backups may persist for a limited time.

## 6. Security
We use industry practices including encryption in transit (TLS), encryption at rest (by Firebase), access control (principle of least privilege), and monitoring. See our Security page for more details.

## 7. Your rights & choices
- **Access, correction, deletion.** Email us to request a copy, correction, or deletion of your data.  
- **Marketing.** We do not send marketing emails.  
- **Push notifications.** Control in iOS Settings.  

### GDPR/UK GDPR
If you are in the EEA/UK, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object, or port data. Our legal basis generally includes consent (where applicable) and legitimate interests (running a safe, functional app).

### CCPA/CPRA (California)
We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by California law. You can request access/deletion via the contact below.

## 8. Children
Guessio is not directed to children under 18 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your region). If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us for removal.

## 9. International transfers
We may process data in the country of our providers (e.g., the EU or US). We rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs) where applicable.
