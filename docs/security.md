# Security & Vulnerability Disclosure

We take security seriously and welcome reports from researchers and the community.

## Practices
- **Data in transit / at rest:** TLS; provider-managed encryption at rest (Firebase).  
- **Access control:** Principle of least privilege for service accounts and Firestore rules.  
- **Secrets:** Stored outside source control; rotated when appropriate.  
- **Monitoring & logging:** Server logs for error and security-relevant events.  
- **Dependency hygiene:** Regular updates and automated checks.

## Report a vulnerability
Please email **security@yourdomain.com** with a description, reproduction steps, and impact.  
We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** and aim to provide an initial assessment within **7 business days**.

**Please do not** publicly disclose before we confirm a fix or 90 days pass (whichever is sooner), unless mutually agreed.

## Out of scope (examples)
- Social engineering against staff/users  
- Physical attacks  
- Issues requiring rooted/jailbroken devices

## Legal safe harbor
If you follow this policy in good faith, we will not pursue or support legal action against you for your research.

## PGP (optional)
If you prefer encrypted email, provide your public key here.
